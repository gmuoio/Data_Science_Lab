The project aims to illustrate how two main factors affect the consumption of electricity in two buildings of the Milano-Bicocca university. The two factors in question are the occurrence of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the weather conditions detected in the area where the university is located. In order to carry out these analyzes, descriptive and predictive models were used in order to investigate the trends and relationships between different phenomena and to provide possible future predictions that could be useful for devising new, better energy strategies. In addition to the use of the most common functions, such as ARIMA and ETS models, a linear regression approach will be presented: spline interpolation. The main results obtained show how the restrictions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted the levels of energy consumed as expected and how the external temperature also affects the amount of energy used. It has been possible to observe how a higher temperature leads to higher consumption, probably due to the switching on of the air conditioning systems, while, during the rest of the year, these grow linearly with the temperature.
